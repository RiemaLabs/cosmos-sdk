# Contributing
This repo intends on preserving the minimal possible diff with [cosmos/cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) to make fetching upstream changes easy. If the proposed contribution is
- specific to Nubit: consider if [nubit-validator](https://github.com/RiemaLabs/nubit-validator) is a better target
- not specific to Nubit: consider making the contribution upstream in [cosmos/cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk)
